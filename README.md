About
-----
**Restack** is small datastructure library based around the [PHP5 SPL Datastructure library][ds].
The main goal of this project is to offer a library with as little coupling and as much flexibility as possible while still providing key benefits of the SPL classes.
Other goals include:

 - Easy to use directly and extend from
 - Item dependency tracking
 - Lightweight
